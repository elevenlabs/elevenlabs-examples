# Video to Sound Effects Demo

We built this demo to show the power of the ElevenLabs Texts to Sounds Effects API. You can upload any video and add AI-generated sound effects.

How it works:

- Extracts 4 frames from the video at 1 second intervals (all client side)
- Sends the frames and a prompt to Gemini 2.0 Flash to create the custom Text to sound effects prompt
- Uses the prompt to create a sound effect with the [ElevenLabs Text to Sounds Effects API](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/api-reference/how-to-use-text-to-sound-effects)
- Combines the video and audio on the client side with ffmpeg.wasm for a single file to download
- Hosted on Vercel at [videotosoundeffects.com](https://www.videotosoundeffects.com/)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
