# Conversational AI SDK Python example

## How to run the code

1. Clone this repo
2. `cd elevenlabs-examples/examples/conversational-ai/python`
3. Follow the [installation instructions](https://pypi.org/project/PyAudio/) for PyAudio.
4. Install the dependencies with either `poetry` or `pip`:

   ```bash
   poetry install
   # Or:
   pip install -e .
   ```

1. Set up environment variables. You must set the agent ID. The API key is required if the agent is not public ("Enable authentication" in the agent settings).

   ```bash
   # Required:
   export AGENT_ID=agentid

   # Optional, for auth-enabled agents:
   export ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=sk_yourkey
   ```

1. Run the demo:

   ```bash
   poetry run demo
   # Or:
   python3 -m convai.demo
   ```

1. You can talk to your agent. The demo will use the system default audio input/output devices - make sure your microphone and speakers or headphones are not muted. You can end the conversation by pressing Ctrl+C.
